## In Progress
(None)

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Use bracket notation for process.env access: `process.env['VARIABLE']` instead of `process.env.VARIABLE` to satisfy exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- next-sanity@11 is compatible with Next.js 15, sanity@4, and @sanity/client@7
- Sanity Studio route needs its own layout.tsx to avoid locale routing conflicts
- Use `as const` for href arrays to satisfy next-intl typed routes

  - exactOptionalPropertyTypes requires careful handling: don't assign undefined to optional props, conditionally add them
  - In-memory rate limiting works for single-server deployments; use Redis for production clusters
  - Resend package provides simple email sending: `resend.emails.send({ to, from, subject, html })`
  - HTML escaping is critical for user-submitted content in emails
  - Test validation by submitting invalid data and checking error responses

## Iteration 23 - US-023: Create blog listing page
- What was implemented:
  - Created `/src/app/[locale]/blog/page.tsx` with full Sanity integration
  - Blog cards showing: cover image, category badge, title, excerpt, date, reading time estimate, author
  - Category filter via URL params (`?category=slug`)
  - Pagination with 10 posts per page (`?page=N`)
  - Empty state when no posts found
  - CTA section at the bottom
  - Added blog translations to all 3 locales (RO/EN/HU)
- Files changed:
  - src/app/[locale]/blog/page.tsx (new)
  - src/messages/ro.json (updated - added blog translations)
  - src/messages/en.json (updated - added blog translations)
  - src/messages/hu.json (updated - added blog translations)
  - PRD.md (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - exactOptionalPropertyTypes: build options objects conditionally instead of assigning undefined
  - Reading time can be estimated from excerpt length (multiply by factor since excerpt is a preview)
  - Category filter links use type cast: `'/blog?category=${slug}' as '/blog'`
  - Pagination shows previous/next arrows plus numbered pages
  - Empty state provides clear feedback and return link when filtered

  - PortableText renderer handles nested marks by processing in reverse order
  - Use `any[]` type for PortableText value to handle various Sanity content structures
  - Video embeds need URL parsing to extract video IDs for YouTube/Vimeo
  - List items must be grouped before rendering to create proper ul/ol elements
