## In Progress
(None)

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Use bracket notation for process.env access: `process.env['VARIABLE']` instead of `process.env.VARIABLE` to satisfy exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- next-sanity@11 is compatible with Next.js 15, sanity@4, and @sanity/client@7
- Sanity Studio route needs its own layout.tsx to avoid locale routing conflicts
- Use `as const` for href arrays to satisfy next-intl typed routes

---

## Session Notes

### 2026-01-15
- PRD created with 42 user stories
- Stories organized in 4 phases by dependency
- Each story sized for single context window (~10 min AI work)
- Foundation already complete: Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, next-intl, Header/Footer/Homepage with placeholder

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Initialize Sanity Studio project
- What was implemented:
  - Installed Sanity dependencies (next-sanity@11, sanity@4, @sanity/client@7, @sanity/image-url, styled-components@6)
  - Created sanity.config.ts at project root
  - Created src/lib/sanity/client.ts with createClient setup and preview client
  - Created sanity/schemas/index.ts (empty, ready for future schemas)
  - Created Sanity Studio route at /studio with dedicated layout
  - Updated .env.example with SANITY_* environment variables
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added dependencies)
  - sanity.config.ts (new)
  - sanity/schemas/index.ts (new)
  - src/lib/sanity/client.ts (new)
  - src/app/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx (new)
  - src/app/studio/[[...tool]]/layout.tsx (new)
  - .env.example (updated)
- Pre-existing type errors fixed:
  - src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx - fixed metadata title/description typing
  - src/components/layout/Footer.tsx - fixed Link href typing with `as const`
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - next-sanity@12+ requires Next.js 16, use @11 for Next.js 15
  - TypeScript exactOptionalPropertyTypes requires explicit string defaults
  - Studio route bypasses locale routing via separate app directory structure
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Create localizedString and localizedText object schemas
- What was implemented:

- Files changed:
  - sanity/schemas/objects/localizedString.ts (new)
  - sanity/schemas/objects/localizedText.ts (new)
  - sanity/schemas/index.ts (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:

  - sanity/schemas/objects/portableText.ts (new)
  - sanity/schemas/objects/localizedPortableText.ts (new)
  - sanity/schemas/index.ts (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use defineArrayMember for array items in Sanity schemas
  - portableText is defined as type 'array' not 'object', containing block and other content types
  - Video embed uses inline object type with name for custom block types
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Create Service document schema
- What was implemented:
  - Created `sanity/schemas/documents/service.ts` with all required fields: title (localizedString), slug, icon, shortDescription, description (localizedPortableText), benefits (array of objects), process (array of steps), heroImage, priceRange, seo, order
  - Added validation for required fields (title, slug)
  - Exported service schema from `sanity/schemas/index.ts`
  - Organized index.ts with comments separating Objects and Documents
- Files changed:
  - sanity/schemas/documents/service.ts (new)
  - sanity/schemas/index.ts (updated)
  - PRD.md (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:

---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Create Testimonial document schema

  - Created `sanity/schemas/documents/testimonial.ts` with all required fields
  - Fields: patientName (string), patientPhoto (image with hotspot), rating (number 1-5), text (localizedText), videoUrl (url), videoFile (file), service (reference), doctor (reference), featured (boolean), date

---

## Iteration 7 - US-007: Create BeforeAfter document schema
- What was implemented:
  - Created `sanity/schemas/documents/beforeAfter.ts` with all required fields

  - sanity/schemas/index.ts (updated)
  - PRD.md (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - BeforeAfter cases use localizedText for description (not localizedPortableText) since rich text isn't needed for brief case descriptions

  - Preview uses afterImage as media to show the successful result
---

## Iteration 8 - US-008: Create BlogPost and BlogCategory schemas
