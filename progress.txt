## In Progress
(None)

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Use bracket notation for process.env access: `process.env['VARIABLE']` instead of `process.env.VARIABLE` to satisfy exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- next-sanity@11 is compatible with Next.js 15, sanity@4, and @sanity/client@7
- Sanity Studio route needs its own layout.tsx to avoid locale routing conflicts
- Use `as const` for href arrays to satisfy next-intl typed routes

---

## Session Notes

### 2026-01-15
- PRD created with 42 user stories
- Stories organized in 4 phases by dependency
- Each story sized for single context window (~10 min AI work)
- Foundation already complete: Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, next-intl, Header/Footer/Homepage with placeholder

  - Props must be sorted: shorthand props (fill, priority) first, then alphabetically
  - Reserved props (key) must be listed first before other props
  - Use bracket notation for index signature access: `block['children']` not `block.children`
  - PortableText rendering can use simple approach with array filtering for basic use cases

  - generateMetadata for SEO
- Files changed:
  - src/app/[locale]/servicii/page.tsx (updated)
  - PRD.md (updated)

  - CTA section with appointment button and phone number
  - generateMetadata for SEO
- Files changed:
